## Hi there

I’m currently learning full-stack development step by step,
with a strong focus on understanding how systems work.

### What I’m focusing on right now
- JavaScript fundamentals (execution, async behavior)
- Backend basics (Node.js, APIs)
- Writing clean, understandable code

### How I’m learning
- Coding every day
- Building small experiments
- Maintaining long-running projects instead of quick demos

I’m documenting my learning through code and commits.
